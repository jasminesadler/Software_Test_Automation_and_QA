How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  To make sure that your code is functional you have to do the basics. Creating code that is clean, simple, and proofread is key. From here you will want tests that have 90% coverage for your program. This way you are testing for every possible input for the program. This way you will be able to catch errors at the beginning and save both time and money. 
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  The easiest way to do this for me is to make a list of what they are asking. Then from there start writing out what you are going to need in your program to make the requests happen. Also, what kind of tests are you going to need to make sure everything is working out. Once I have this layout then I will begin writing the program out. 
  
How do I approach designing software?

  When you begin to design software start off small and then begin to build from that. You should be running tests individually as you add then to help catch errors. This is going to help you be more efficient and less stressed out. This way you can fix problems as your going along and not at the end when they have added all up.
